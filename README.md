Our team developed a training website for the employees of Seaview Golf Club's restaurant using the Flask framework in Python. 

This website contains an employee dashboard, where employees can take their assigned quizzes.

In addition, a manager dashboard has also been implemented and consists of various features, such as being able to create/edit/delete accounts, create quizzes, view quiz trends, and more.


Required Downloads:
- Flask
- WKHMTLToPDF (needed for PDFKit)
- SQLite

To run this project, a "credentials.py" file is required. This file contains the email address and its password that will be used in order to send announcements from the manager's dashboard.

We have deployed the website using Python Anywhere, and it can be accessed here: https://seaviewtraining.pythonanywhere.com/
